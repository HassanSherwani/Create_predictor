# Create a Predictor

We have three datasets with each data set having its own predictor.We will apply concepts from Econometrics, machine learning and deep learning.

# Content

There are five notebooks in this repository;

- 1)-Preprocessing: Deals with data exploration and cleaning parts using numpy, matplotlib,seaborn, pandas libraries.

- 2)-Dataset_Inspection: Using pandas_profiling module, there is an overview of three datasets.

- 3)-Model1-Econometrics: This notebook deals with linear models often used in econometrics & statistics using statemodels libraries.

- 4)-Model2-Machine_Learning2.0: This notebook deals with non-linear models and boosting algorithms using sklearn libraries.

- 5)-Model3_Deep_learning: This notebook opens concepts of deeplearning using tensorflow and keras libraries.
